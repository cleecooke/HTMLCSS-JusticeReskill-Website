    <h1>Reskilling America's Justice-Involved Community</h1>

    <br/>

<h4>Building new futures for the justice-involved community</h5>

<p>
    Justice Reskill offers the justice-involved community much more than a fresh start or a second chance.
    With training in high-level technical skills and essential career-focused support, we’re empowering
    justice-involved individuals to transcend personal and societal limitations to secure long-term professional
    & financial success.

<h2>The justice-involved community faces often insurmountable odds towards reentry</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Among the 70 million formerly incarcerated folks in the US, about 27% are unemployed</li>
    <li>Between 60 -75% are unemployed 1 year after release</li>
    <li>50 - 63% are less likely to get a job application callback</li>
    <li>Individuals net worth decreases $47,500 in the years after incarceration</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Black Americans make up only 13% of the US population but 40% of our prison population</li>
    <li>Latino/Hispanic Americans make up only 16% of the US population but 19% of our prison population</li>

<h2>Racial and ethnic disparities are a defining characteristic of our criminal justice system.</h2>

    <h3>Our Solution</h3>
    <p>
        Justice Reskill works to secure greater opportunity and long-term financial stability for the justice-involved
        community. With our accessible learning platform and our vibrant network of support, we equip our participants
        with the resources and environment they need to achieve lasting career success.
    </p>

<div class="boxes">
    <h4>Wealth Generation</h4>
    <p>
        We set our participants on a course to earn true career-level wages, which are crucial for accumulating the
        personal and family savings necessary to take on future opportunities and overcome inevitable setbacks.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="boxes">
    <h4>Community</h4>
    <p>
        Community is not a given for many justice-involved individuals; thus, we actively cultivate a sense of
        belonging for all participants, along with an inclusive professional network that we hope offers lifelong
        career support.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="boxes">
    <h4>Future-Focused Skills</h4>
    <p>
        Unlike existing learn-to-code platforms, which focus exclusively on technical skills, we also equip our
        participants with the “soft” skills and knowledge needed to thrive in a technology-related career.
    </p>    
</div>

<div class="boxes">
    <h3>Whole Person Support</h3>
    <p>
        To fix the broken journeys of our community, we must eliminate barriers like lack of access, mental health
        issues, and financial illiteracy. We confront these realities with intentional programming and partnerships
        focused on strengthening the whole person.
